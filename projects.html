<h2 id ="rsa">
	<a href="https://github.com/davidretler/RSA-Encryptor">RSA Encryption</a>
</h2>
<p>
    As an honors project for a Discrete Math class, a classmate an I wrote
    a program to perform RSA encryption in Java. The program features a
    graphical user interface which allows the user to enter various inputs
    such as public/private keys, a message to encrypt, and an encrypted message
    to decrypt. The software also supports key generation for various different
    key sizes.

    A <a href="./content/poster.pdf">poster</a>
    was presented at the Ocean County College Scholarly Horizons Honors Conference, in Fall 2014.

<h2 id="compression">
	<a href="./content/slides.pdf">Image Compression</a>
</h2>
<p>
    For a Linear Algebra class, a classmate and I designed and implemented a
    JPEG-like image compression algorithm, applying the discrete cosine transform
    and other important theorems from Linear Algebra. The algorithm was implemented
    in MATLAB and successfully compressed photographic images.

    For this project, we won the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics
    (STEM) prize at the Spring 2015 Ocean County College Scholarly Horizons
    Honors Conference. The presentation given can be viewed <a href="./content/slides.pdf">here</a>, 
    and the code can be browsed <a href="https://github.com/chrisetler/ImageMean">here</a>.

<h2 id="nbody">
	<a href="https://github.com/davidretler/N-Body">Orbital Simulator</a>
</h2>
<p>
    During the Summer of 2015, I wrote a lightweight application in C to numerically
    solve the N-Body problem. The program takes a list of bodies (planets, stars, etc)
    from a text file, and simulates the gravitational orbits of the bodies
    using differential equations. The program features OpenGL 2D graphics to
    show the evolution of the system over time.

<h2 id="chatFlix">
	<a href="https://github.com/Zero6/chatFlix">ChatFlix</a>
</h2>
<p>
  For the HackNJIT 2015 NJIT Hackathon, my roomates and I wrote an Android application 
  for chatting about TV shows over the internet. The app uses Atlassian's HipChat API 
  to send messages in chatrooms based on your selected show. The app also makes 
  use of a database of TV shows/movies and their descriptions, allowing the user 
  to search through shows.

<h2 id="sudoku">
	<a href="https://github.com/davidretler/SudokuSolverAndroid">Sudoku Solver for Android</a>
</h2>
<p>
	In the winter of 2015 I wrote a Sudoku board solving app for Android. The
	application allows the user to enter a Sudoku board for which the app will
	find a valid solution (or inform the user if there is no solution). A recursive
	backtracking algorithm was used to solve the board. The application allows the
	user to see the solution step-by-step, or skip to the full solution.
