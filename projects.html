<h2 id ="rsa"><a href="https://github.com/davidretler/RSA-Encryptor">RSA Encryption</a></h2>
<p>
    As an honors project for a Discrete Math class, a classmate an I wrote
    a program to perform RSA encryption in Java. The program features a
    graphical user interface which allows the user to enter various inputs
    such as public/private keys, a message to encrypt, and an encrypted message
    to decrypt. The software also supports key generation for various different
    key sizes.

    A <a href="/content/poster.pdf">poster</a>
    was presented at the Ocean County College Scholarly Horizons Honors Conference, in Fall 2014.

<h2 id="compression"><a href="https://github.com/chrisetler/ImageMean">Image Compression</a></h2>
<p>
    For a Linear Algebra class, a classmate and I designed and implemented a
    JPEG-like image compression algorithm, applying the discrete cosine transform
    and other important theorems from Linear Algebra. The algorithm was implemented
    in MATLAB and successfully compressed photographic images.

    For this project, we won the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics
    (STEM) prize at the Spring 2015 Ocean County College Scholarly Horizons
    Honors Conference. The presentation given can be viewed <a href="/content/slides.pdf">here</a>.

<h2 id="nbody"><a href="https://github.com/davidretler/N-Body">N-Body Simulator</a></h2>
<p>
    During the Summer of 2015, I wrote a lightweight application in C to numerically
    solve the N-Body problem. The program takes a list of bodies (planets, stars, etc)
    from a text file, and simulates the gravitational orbits of the bodies
    using differential equations. The program features OpenGL 2D graphics to
    show the evolution of the system over time.
