    <h2 id="rsa"><a href="https://github.com/davidretler/RSA-Encryptor">RSA Encryption</a></h2>
    <p>
        As an honors project for a Discrete Math class, a classmate an I wrote
        a program to perform RSA encryption in Java. The program features a
        graphical user interface which allows the user to enter various inputs
        such as public/private keys, message to encrypt, and an encrypted message
        to decrypt. The software also supports key generation for various different
        key sizes.

        A <a href="content/poster.pdf">poster</a>
        was presented at the Ocean County College Scholarly Horizons Honors Conference, in Fall 2014.

    <h2 id="compression"><a href="https://github.com/chrisetler/ImageMean">Image Compression</a></h2>
    <p>
        For a Linear Algebra class, a classmate and I designed and implemented a
        JPEG-like image compression algorithm, applying the discrete cosine transform
        and other important theorems from Linear Algebra. The algorithm was implemented
        in MATLAB and successfully compressed photographic images.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this project, we won the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics
        (STEM) prize at the Spring 2015 Ocean County College Scholarly Horizons
        Honors Conference. The presentation given can be viewed <a href="content/slides.pdf">here</a>.
